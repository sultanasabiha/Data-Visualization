Yes,100-500,2019,34,31-40,Undecided,1,"Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder.  The context was a meeting between several coworkers, including one who was suffering greatly from anxiety, which was impeding her work. I explained that I could understand what she was going through because of my own experiences with anxiety and depression. My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me.   It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship. As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself.

I've had discussions with coworkers who work at the same company as me but not directly alongside me about mental health issues. I only felt comfortable having the discussions because I was fairly confident that they also struggled with mental health. I told my manager that a project I was managing was making me anxious. We worked out ways that he could help me change how I thought about it and help me with it to make me less anxious.

However, when the director met with me for an evaluation, he addressed some concerns around breaks I was taking.  It was at this point I shared with him the conversations I had with the other two staff members and how I was addressing these gaps with their support.  His response was ""well while I appreciate the whole depression thing, you have to do your job"" and from that point forward, I found him treating me differently, for example, scheduling a meeting for a day when I was taking PTO where he shared information that directly impacted my team.  I made decisions about which coworkers to discuss mental health with, but I have had conversations over lunch (off-site) about periodic anxiety, as well as conversations with some of my team mates about my misophonia as it has impacts on my focus and concentration in meetings so I like to make people aware of it so I can ask for accommodations when needed.   Again the misophonia piece.  Additionally, I had open conversations with select colleagues about my anxiety and depression.  I spoke openly about my misophonia with anyone I had to share working spaces with.  I also spoke with my direct supervisor about some emotional needs I had periodically, but only after we had developed a trusting working relationship.

All this happened AFTER the company I worked for had their annual ""year start"" gathering in SFO. When it became apparent that I have anxiety, and it was interfering with my ability to complete tasks, my boss put me on a PIP that was impossible to achieve. I missed one task that was unclear the first week, and that was grounds enough for them to fire me. They paid me severance, offered me a ""soft landing"".

I now realize getting fired was probably a good thing.  However, at the time I made it clear I was not giving up and admitting defeat. The company I worked for, who champions mental health issues! No stigma! Open discussion! When I broke down and told my boss about my anxiety during a 1:1 and several questions had been posed (the answer to most was ""because of my anxiety""), he probably made the decision right there that he wasn't going to keep me because I was a pain to deal with.   Me to my coworker: something about depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate, how it physically manifests itself daily. I feel like this job may kill me.
My coworker, back to me: Oh, yes. That happens to me too (anxiety/depression/imposter syndrome/feeling inadequate).
me back to coworker: Boss dishes out the stress, definitely. Can you imagine the insane amount of stress he's under? Does he ever sleep?  My supervisor was dumbfounded the first time he observed me during a (job-related) anxiety attack when I completely forgot how to do something simple and routine. He spent two hours asking me leading questions to help me solve my problem instead of gently reminding me. I thought I was going to cry. He said ""what can I do to help you"", made a few suggestions, faked empathy. And then fired me three months later after creating a performance plan that was impossible to complete successfully.  Discussing imposter syndrome, feeling like you can't take a break, nothing gets done fast enough.
The response from my coworker was a lot of ""oh yea, me too""
 Explained to my boss that I had to pause in the middle of a late night deployment because I was physically ill with worry that the deploy was going to break in a spectactular manner and I wouldn't be able to quickly fix it. I had no idea at the time that this is anxiety. I'm sure my boss knew. my coworker/good friend was describing how sad she was feeling after several traumatic events in rapid succession and bad turn of events at work.

Yes,More than 1000,2019,31,31-40,Female,1,"  I've mentioned that I have mental illness and am in therapy, and they have always been very supportive.

Once I had to advocate for myself in regards to my anxiety, and they were very accommodating. They related to what I was telling them and asked some questions to understand. I was in a difficult situation where the clinic where I was being treated for my eating disorder had changed its clinical model, making me ineligible for care. 

I was dealing with a lot of stress and sat down with my boss to let him know what was going on.

He was very supportive, telling me to take the time I needed to get things sorted out, and let me cry in his office.

I felt very supported and safe. At one job I told a coworker about how the work was negatively affecting my mental health. She was very concerned and encouraged me to reach out to my boss/HR and to seek help. She was very supportive, even if the environment we were in was not. When first entering treatment for my eating disorder I told my boss that I was taking the day off for a medical intake. She asked what kind of intake.

I wasn't really comfortable talking about it with her, but told her anyway because I was worried it would look badly to not share.

She became very awkward and stiff. A coworker once confided in me about some struggles he was going through with his depression, and we talked about it together and went over some strategies.

A colleague once told me that they had almost committed suicide on the way to work that morning when they were crossing a bridge.

Yes,More than 1000,2019,24,21-30,Female,1,"  I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis. My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation. This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally.

I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about. We only have an HDHP and I find it difficult to justify therapy and mental healthcare when I will otherwise come nowhere near my deductible. Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan.

Yes,26-100,2017,35,31-40,Female,1,"  Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude Last year I was dealing with an active episode of depression.  Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.  A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it  ",1,Above Average,Maybe,Canada,0,,Yes,Maybe,Yes,"      Anxiety Disorder (Generalized, Social, Phobia, etc)        Yes   Eating Disorder (Anorexia, Bulimia, etc) Possibly   Often Rarely      Mood Disorder (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, etc)                      ",1,1

I was immediately treated differently and with suspicion, subjected to unfair treatment intended to ‘help’ me that made matters much worse, was pressured into letting my supervisors contact my therapist and psychiatrist and ask questions about me, and then fired after my supervisors totally misinterpreted the answers they received. Even the HR department at the university was surprised by how badly they handled it. One of my coworkers has ongoing problems with anxiety and depression. It causes problems with her being able to come to work regularly and we have had several conversations trying to find ways to support her as well as let the team keep working together successfully.

Most people in my previous company worked remotely, which has pros and cons for certain kinds of mental health issues.  We'd have somewhat open conversations about the fact that it was a unique issue for our company, but I don't think any tailored program was ever created.

People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments   It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work.

I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others.

Discussed burnout which is a combination of mostly anxiety and physical symptoms like severe back pain and increased heart rate and trouble sleeping.

After numerous conversations with HR I finally got a new manager but this did not resolve other incompetencies with management and the business strategy. I was told I could ask a dr for a note to use my sick time to recover. I was not given the option to take medical leave or short term disability for the back pain that was so severe I couldn’t stand up straight one day, and had to go home early several times.

I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma. Was having a particularly bad anxiety episode that had lasted a few days and was negatively affecting work so I asked if I could take a few days off, and explained why. He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized.

No,26-100,2018,31,31-40,Male,1,"  It was a mixed bag. We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate. I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward. Oh my... An open question... First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me. I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue.    One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions. I told him that he was more than competent, that he was not an impostor.
